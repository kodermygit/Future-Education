                <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of
                    teacher
                    absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India,
                    particularly
                    in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools.
                    Government
                    'recognition'actually fulfil all the conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of
                    unrecognised primary schools suggests that schools and parents do not take government recognition as
                    a
                    stamp of quality.

                <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru
                    prabhu. The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was
                    very important part of the education. Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded
                    centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE.Instead of exams being held every
                    academic year, school students attend three exams, in classes 2, 5 and 8. Board exams are held for
                    classes 10 and 12.
